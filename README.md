DASISH survey tools - common metadata documents and files
=========================================================


A key aim for the three DASISH task 3.2 tools is that they should be able to communicate with each other. To facilitate interoperability between the three tools work towards a common metadata understanding has been carried out. This work is further described in the document ‘DASISH 3.2 Towards a common metadata understanding for the three DASISH WP3.2 tools 2015_01_05.pdf’.  A summary, including the requirements for a common metadata model for the three tools as well as the main agreements made between the DASISH task 3.2 partners is found below.

The requirements for a common metadata model for the three DASISH task 3.2 tools are defined as follows:

1. Which metadata elements will be used in the transfer between the three tools?
2. The direction for the flow of metadata elements between the three tools, as well as the steps in the work process at which metadata components are exchanged.
3. Mapping between the metadata elements and DDI.
4. A common identification and versioning system.
5. How the exchange of DDI metadata takes place, which type of DDI instances or fragments that will be transported, and which type of web-service will be used.
6. Administrative ownership of metadata


This project contains documents related to a common metadata understanding for the three DASISH WP3.2 tools. It also contains DDI XML instances as well as controlled vocabularies and DDI element hierarchies.
